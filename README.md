# boogit

boogit is born from the frustration of using `git blame` to track the successive 
editors of a code segment.
It performs a search on a file commits history and reports all the
modified lines that contain searched term.

The name is inspired from The Jackson's 1978 disco hit "Blame It on the Boogie".
